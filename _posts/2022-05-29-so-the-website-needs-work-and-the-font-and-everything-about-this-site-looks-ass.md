and i am not composed,

and the format is not conducive to creativity

let’s think about how to do this

i quite admire the 2002 easy to read scholarly-type boomer-friendly low fidelity things,

What is the point of making a post

what is the point of keeping a blog

i’m not sure, i’m going to water my plants tomorrow

<s>im going to</s> i’m going to not say what i was going to do

1. the point of the blog is not to discuss my personal life like a diary, especially for things where the purpose feels defeated for announcing it on a public post–
2. because this is an experiment, i feel the need to exercise some responsibility
3. one day i will free myself of that burden when i have completed more stories in their whollest form–
4. to explore the conflicting emotions of ‘online-poster’s paralysis’

else…. who might read this, iuno, someone who gaf

Another nugget– my blog , since it’s not my journal, shall not be advertised, per-se, but i shall not hope for it to remain private(I know i go out of my way to hide anything that reveals myself). I am aiming for, hidden in plain sight

Thoughts are my own– oh good, then it’s time to lay out a radicalized manifesto–

Despite what anyone thinks of when they think of me, they don’t know that this venture of mine is possibly damning to my psyche as I experience a protective hopelessness when it comes to sharing my ideas with anyone.

6\. that I err on the side of being self-aware and commentating of my brain — without exposing the bloody details of said samskara

7\. that i don’t think too hard about whether it’s right or wrong to say terms that go unexplained– but that would defeat the purpose of an online post– wouldn’t it? ahh…

8\. to further cleave the differences between blog and journal– as much as i enjoy indulging in the latter– and to try to enjoy the former for what it is, as much as possible, in as creative and bat-shit limitless as I dream

9\. To not be counterproductive in writing a blog post or think too much on the consequences or delivery of a blog-post. to focus on the essence and authenticity that goes into something interesting that should be a blog post. ie. if something is happening in my life or writing this is preventing me from living my life for some reason or I don’t deem it<s> aligns with</s> makes sense w/ my goals in life then I can stop making a post or pursuing a continuous topic <s>at any time without warning.</s> this is not a mf’ing Legal Contract

10\. I think 9. was two things, so I’ll recite: *“To not be counterproductive in writing a blog post or think too much on the consequences or delivery of a blog-post…”*

I think that 10 is really important… I really don’t like to type in full sentences if it digresses me getting the feeling across right. I believe in the art of forming great writing no matter how achieved

so

i

can

do

shit

like

this

… if i feel it works

no periods either

sorr

I also really don’t know to whom this shall be for other than for myself

I will simply offer it to the world… since it’s one of my ideas that i keep locked away

truly, it’s one of my more private things. I’ve grown to value the advantages of privacy in my life– in turn this scared me from doing anything , i would’ve said, ‘of value’–ie. ‘to sell yourself out’ . in honour of being authentic– that’s all i wanna leave here <s>cuz’ fuck</s> my mind

On the contrary: To sell yourself out is the *opposite* of being authentic

To be honest, i want people to look at me and not be so basic with their thinking, ‘she must be abc xyz’, i grow quite tired of that commentary

but let’s focus on why I have friends who don’t do that

For a long time my fear gets the best of me, tricking myself, accepting repulsion– that if I provide something ‘of value’ it’s like selling my organs and I won’t be free for a long time

To look at that ‘repulsion’ in a word as simple as that, and to not give it a complicated hard-to-understand thing that doesn’t get us closer to understanding its methodology– such as ‘self-sabotage’, kinda makes you feeling like there’s a winner and a loser in yourself, further dividing yourself,

to give a concept more simplicity– something I can feel on a physical level, not an intellectual one

finding such words is … relieving…. liberating, calming,

and I feel sorry for anyone who is wrestling with calling themselves so many complicated things, such as my past-self

11\. Explore the meanings you get across by letting the filter come off for a string of thoughts– since i have no responsibility , no occupation when i post

to understand responsibility — there is a greater responsibility in being authentic

not, ‘responsibility’ as a way to scare myself into not saying this or that

I have ultimate freedom, I get the first say, as long as I wrote this before anyone has any input, i have the freedom of taking this in any direction i please

the very first actual piece of writing i’ll publish, behind a screen, maybe even with a name that attaches to it,

this is why I cannot address this post in second person, “you” the one reading this, i have to assume, that , if someone else is reading this text, you, are the reader. even if i’m in this room by myself, pre-empting, feeling absolutely foolish, surfing over negative feelings– feelings of worthlessness, the thought-generating machine that still has a medium voice in my mind.

You, I address, you. when my words seem rambly, possibly I forget you, or i don’t think much of, you

I think that this goes w/o saying, since I have absolute freedom:

12\. No rules shall be established at this time.

only philosophies on why i am writing this

ie. there is no rule that a blog talks ‘about’ topics

it might be loosely categorized–

the pattern of posts will not be detected until quite a long time i imagine

*<sup>Scope:</sup>*

my posting frequency is still up in the air, there is no obligation to post– only that there is an update at any given time–meaning i may post 5x in 1 day then vaporize for 3 months, or post meaningfully as part of an experiment for once each month for 8 months

whether I run straight ahead like i am now or decide to format retroactively at the mercy of finding desirable content

oh

 no

she

 messing it all up

- srah

closing: i am more calmed now that when i started– that was cathartic

13\. *To myself, and reader: each post<s> shall be</s> is a learning experience in itself and there is no pre-emptive feeling \[at the time of writing\] that <s>is valid</s> holds sound judgment in a space like this*

may 29 –

ie. if this makes sense, it makes sense

if this doesn’t make sense, i’ll find out anytime AFTER I publish– not before

…or if i’m lucky it’ll make no sense then make sense– or the other way around– it’ll make sense then make no sense– isn’t that what it’s like to be bad at something?

“Everything starts hard when learning, with time– it gets easier”, i’m testing this

14\. (before publishing) I shall add a tag at will, however any categorizing shall not be done at the time of publishing unless there’s a really good specific calling to it– i am already tempted to run ‘no-filter’ across this post before letting it ever breathe in its existence

15\. measures can be taken, given i feel the appreciation towards responsibility to look after how the posts are taken, not to modify its meaning so reflexively

16\. at the beginning of every post i shall determine whether or not it benefits from having a meaning at the time of writing it

i’m debating #rant posts

you’ll def get a #won’t get half the ref’s post

will it serve me well to think of ‘you’?

not to imagine ‘your’ frustration in how i take attitude in my posts and ‘your’ reaction,

feeling up or down, you will get what i say with clarity

‘you’ will peer into whatever i am saying and it’s all open to you for your reading

should i have sympathy for ‘you’ in how i write? maybe not to begin with–

still, the more i write , ‘you’ the more established this feels

you you you you you you — not me me

blog vs. journal
