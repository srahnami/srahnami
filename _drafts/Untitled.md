in a mood like this – – thinking about how the way i organize is more complicated than a notebook sized article

I really appreciate a piece of well-thought out curriculum based off some science of learning

every piece of learning needs an input component which is underrated — ie. an excel workbook i can play with, speaking input on duolingo in conversation mode and flashcard mode and sentence mode — call and response

the listening and watching and , typing out code is overrated when it comes to coding

having a mentor is important

detachment  
let go of tags  
view unfiltered by date captured, non destructive sorting

arvice, 2-3 years old, mentally confused at a later date  
presume you’ve made some progress w/ organizing, between journally, and stuff…  
a blog post responding, or revisiting one of hte takeaways that evrenote had, neot organized the way wexpect  
rightn owi have my ipad laptop computer, 3-4 screens

‘why tags blow’

well if i take a screenshot while i’m watching a video

or snap a photo when i’m having a good time with friends

i’m acknoledging that this has a mental impression, and yes, i can appreciate it in that moment–

planting the seeds

how does this actually work, organizing, naming, even if i’ts imperfect

what i’m not a fan of is moving things

what i’m a fan of is filters

what i value
